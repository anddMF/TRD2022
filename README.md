### ‚ùì How it works
TRD2022 has three main engines:
- <b>Recommendation</b>
  - uses three types of calculation, that can be turned off in appsettings.json, with candlesticks combined with a moving average validation. It can recommend N number of assets and it's up to the buy engine to decide which one will enter and balance the three types of recommendations. 
- <b>Buy</b>
  - responsible to receive the recommendations and try to buy the assets in a good time. It has validations to make attempts to buy the asset in an up valorization, if exceeds the maximum number of attempts without finding a good spot to buy, it will try the next recommended asset. The validations and loops try to prevent purchases of assets that started a bear market.
- Sell
